# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üö¢üîç

I had the opportunity to dive deep into the famous **Titanic dataset**, where I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover hidden insights and patterns within the data.

## Project Overview

In this task, I focused on cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the Titanic dataset to draw meaningful conclusions about the survival rates and other key factors. Here's a summary of the steps I took:

### Key Steps and Insights:

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Started by handling missing values, ensuring data consistency, and transforming categorical variables to prepare the dataset for analysis.
   - Standardized the dataset for better readability and accuracy in further analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted in-depth EDA to uncover relationships between various features like **age**, **gender**, **class**, and their influence on survival rates.
   - Explored patterns in survival rates based on passenger class, gender, and embarked location.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created **heatmaps** to visualize the correlations between different variables.
   - Developed insightful **bar charts**, **histograms**, and other plots to represent the data and findings clearly.
   - Visualized survival rates based on key factors to help better understand the overall data distribution and relationships.

### Tools and Technologies:

- **Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning and transformation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries utilized to create clear and informative visualizations, including heatmaps and other charts.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For running analysis and visualizing results interactively.

## Learnings and Reflections

This project provided an excellent learning experience in:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conducting thorough exploratory data analysis
- Visualizing key patterns and insights in the data

It reinforced my skills in preparing datasets for analysis and creating meaningful visual representations to communicate findings. I‚Äôm excited to continue growing as a data scientist and taking on more challenges like this!
